# KeyBERT Document Analysis Tool

## Overview
This Python script is a tool designed to perform document analysis using the KeyBERT package. It aims to extract keywords from text chunks and organize them for further analysis. The code also includes functionality to split text into smaller chunks, extract keywords, and create a database of analyzed documents.

## Features

### 1. Keyword Extraction
The script uses KeyBERT to extract keywords from text chunks using various parameters, such as n-gram range and diversity settings.

### 2. Text Chunking
Utilizes text splitting functionality to break down large documents into smaller, manageable chunks for analysis.

### 3. Document Analysis
Generates a structured database of analyzed documents containing metadata like document titles, authors, URLs, and extracted keywords for each chunk.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Libraries: keybert, transformers, langchain, tiktoken
- Additional Dependencies: tqdm, rich

## Usage

### Running the Script
1. Ensure all required libraries are installed by running `!pip install keybert transformers langchain tiktoken`.
2. Run the provided Python script.
3. Modify the input text and parameters as needed for your analysis.

### Example Usage
- Modify the `text` variable to input your desired document text.
- Adjust parameters in the `extract_keys()` function for different keyword extraction settings.
- Explore the extracted keywords and structured document data generated by the script.
